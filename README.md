## ⚡ Core Research & IP: AlphaGuardian

Most AI Trading Agents are built on hallucinations—they ignore **slippage, funding rates, and look-ahead bias**. I develop the **"Logic Guard"** that stops them.

* **Research**: [AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework (arXiv:2512.22476)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2512.22476)
* **Status**: Under Review at **Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)**.
* **Key Tech**:
* **SFI (Semantic Fault Injection)**: A proprietary stress-test methodology to break fragile agent logic.
* **Strict T+1 Semantics**: A mathematical gateway that enforces backtest-to-live consistency.
* **Auditable Decision Certificates**: Deterministic, machine-readable evidence for every on-chain action.
