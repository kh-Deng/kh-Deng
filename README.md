# AlphaGuardian (AutoQuant)

### The Verifiable Risk & Logic Layer for Agentic Finance

**AlphaGuardian** (formerly AutoQuant) is an auditable expert-system framework designed to bridge the gap between "hallucinated alpha" and "verifiable execution" in AI-driven trading. It provides a deterministic **Logic Guard** for autonomous agents, ensuring every trade is mathematically validated against look-ahead bias and execution realism.

## 🛡️ Why AlphaGuardian?

Most AI Agents operate in a **"Black Box"**: they hallucinate profits by ignoring market friction or using future data. **AlphaGuardian** acts as the **Pre-frontal Cortex** for these agents, enforcing strict risk-control and logic-consistency.

### Core Capabilities:

* **Strict T+1 Execution Semantics**: Eliminates look-ahead bias by enforcing a formal separation between signal generation () and execution ().
* **Semantic Fault Injection (SFI)**: Proactively stress-tests agent logic by injecting "synthetic failures" (e.g., stale data, funding rate spikes) to verify agent resilience.
* **Cost-Aware Verification**: Full accounting of slippage, taker fees, and funding rates—turning theoretical "paper trading" into production-ready strategies.
* **Deterministic Audit Trails**: Generates machine-readable evidence for every decision, making AI actions auditable for DAOs, funds, and retail users.

## 🔬 Research-Driven Engineering

The framework is the practical implementation of my research submitted to **Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)**:

> **AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Financial Strategy Verification**.

| Feature | Technical Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Logic Guarding** | Intercepts agent signals and validates them against an **Auditable Expert System**. |
| **Backtest Consistency** | Ensures 1:1 parity between simulation and live execution through **Strict Semantics**. |
| **Kill-Switch Guard** | A supervisor module that halts trading if live performance deviates from the Bayesian baseline. |

## 🧩 Ecosystem Integration

While chain-agnostic, AlphaGuardian provides ready-to-use adapters for:

* **AI Frameworks**: ElizaOS (Plugin-ready), custom AI Agents.
* **Infrastructure**: Injective (DEX/Perps), dYdX (v4 Support), Arbitrum ecosystem.

---

## 📂 Project Structure & Showcase

* `/core_engine`: Proprietary Bayesian optimization and logic validation engine. (Closed Source)
* `/plugin_eliza`: An open-source adapter allowing ElizaOS agents to call `Guardian.check()` before execution.
* `/showcase`:
* `run_demo.py`: Reproducible script demonstrating the **Kill-Switch** in action.
* `exports/latest/report.html`: A sample of the **Auditable Decision Certificate** generated by the system.
